  <h2><u>Who Am I?</u></h2>
  <p class="bodytext"><b>My work is driven by pop culture references. 
    More specifically, I create pieces from or inspired by comic books, tabletop games, and video games. 
    The greatest part about art is developing and discovering new methods. 
    In recent years, my work has become more personal and created for fun, 
    but I have reentered the academic scene in order to some day become a professional.</b></p>

  <p class="bodytext">Born January 24th, 2003 as Alaina Grace Lalnunkimi Kaiser, Alaina lived in Wichita, Kansas with her twin sister, 
    mother, and father for a couple of years before moving to Gardner, Kansas where they welcomed two cats into the 
    family. During elementary school, Alaina learned about comic books and video games from her father which 
    sparked the start of artistic creation inside of her. At the age of 7, Alaina started with writing and drawing 
    her own comic books, characters, and video game concept panels in pencil before moving up to acrylic painting 
    just a year later.  In the 3rd grade, she and her family moved to Tonganoxie, Kansas for the remaining years of
     her elementary schooling. When she approached the middle school years, Alaina took all art classes available and 
     learned then how to use clay, papier-mâché, and honed in her sketching techniques. However, Alaina wasn’t 
     interested in making art as anything more than a hobby at that time as she wanted to be a video game programmer. 
     At this time, many of her pieces were video game related and mostly in the realm of medieval fantasy. In high 
     school, Alaina changed her career direction from video game programmer to video game designer after taking a 
     college course dedicated to design. From then on she took every opportunity to participate in video game tests 
     and work on side design projects.
    ​
    She plans on graduating from Full Sail University in 2023 as a Game Design major, with the possibility of 
    pursuing a Game Design master's degree.</p>
